We are group of researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC) interested in topics at the intersections of health, machine learning, privacy, ethics, and security. We aspire to build usable privacy-enhancing systems that can be readily deployed in healthcare domains. We pursue a variety of projects and collaborations in different domains, some of which are detailed below.

### Current projects

- [Federated health ML systems survey](./systems-survey.md)
- [Explaining differential privacy](./explaining-dp.md)
- [Optimizing privacy budget in differential privacy](./budget-optimization.md)
- [Preserving privacy with data synthesis](./synthesizing-data.md)
- [Federated ML across RedCap databases](./federated-ml-rcap.md)

### Applications of our research

- [Endometriosis](./app-endometriosis.md)
- [Digital pathology](./app-digital-pathology.md)

### People

Our research team includes:

- [Aline Talhouk](http://alinetalhouk.com/) (Professor in the Faculty of Medicine at UBC)
- [Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/) (Professor in Computer Science at UBC)
