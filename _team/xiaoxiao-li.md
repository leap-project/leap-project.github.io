## Assistant Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UBC

I am an Assistant Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UBC. Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at Princeton University (working with Dr. Kai Li and Dr. Olga Troyanskaya), and obtained my PhD degree from Yale University in 2020 (working with Dr. James Duncan).

My current research lies in both developing machine algorithms/theories and their applications, such as in the field of biomedical data analysis. Our research topics cover trustworthy AI, data-centric AI, federated learning, un-/weakly-/semi-supervised learning, and blockchain.
