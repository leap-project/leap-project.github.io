## MSc Student in Computer Science at UBC

I am a MSc student at the University of British Columbia, under the supervision of Ivan Beschastnikh and Aline Talhouk. My interests revolve around building secure and privacy-preserving systems, where I collaborate closely with Mathias LÃ©cuyer. More precisely, I explore novel ways for systems providing differential privacy to conserve their privacy budget.

I am also interested in creatively employing visualization techniques to debug the performance of large distributed systems, building distributed frameworks to support data analytics and machine learning, and researching kernel bypassing methods to optimize user-space file systems.
