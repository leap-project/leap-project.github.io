## Professor in Computer Science at UBC

I am an associate professor of in Computer Science in the Faculty of Science at the University of British Columbia. I have broad research interests that usually touch on systems and software engineering. My current projects span distributed systems, formal methods, networks, and security. I enjoy building and studying real software systems and tend to be empirical in my research.

I started at UBC in the Summer of 2013. Before this I was working on my PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle. At UW I worked with Tom Anderson, Michael Ernst, and Arvind Krishnamurthy on tools to infer models of complex systems from logs of their behavior, networked testbeds, DHTs, and other fun topics.
