## Professor in Computer Schience at UBC

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Schience at UBC. Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at Microsoft Research in NY, and even before I completed my PhD at Columbia University under the supervision of Roxana Geambasu, Augustin Chaintreau, and Daniel Hsu.

I am broadly interested in machine learning systems, with a specific focus on applications that provide rigorous guarantees of robustness, privacy, and security. My research focuses both on improving practical and theoretical tools (differential privacy, causal inference, reinforcement learning) and enabling specific use-cases (ML attacks/defenses, privacy preserving data management, system decisions optimization).
